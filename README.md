# Level one header

This is a short level one description

## Level two header

_This should be italic_ and so should *this*. But __this should be bold__ and so should **this**. And _here we have a **combination**_ or *this __too__*.

This is a __first__ commit

## Here we look at lists

* this is item __1__
* this is item __2__

here is another way to do lists

1. this is item _1_
1. this is item _2_
    1. this is subitem _1_
    1. this is subitem _2_
1. this is item _3_

### This is a level 3 header
